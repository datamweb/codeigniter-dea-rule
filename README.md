**`CodeIgniter DEA Rule`** helps you to validate the email provided by the user and to deal with it if the email was of Temporary & Disponsable Emails(DEA) use type.
**`CodeIgniter DEA Rule`** is actually a [custom validation rule](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/validation.html?#creating-custom-rules), but with more features than a rule.

**`CodeIgniter DEA Rule`** allows you to check emails in a comprehensive list of Temporary & Disponsable Emails(DEA), but it is not satisfied with this amount, you can create a custom database(file)/list of emails that you recognize as disposable.

In this project, as much as possible, the *Code Quality Control Tools used by the Codeigniter4 Core Team* have been used.
